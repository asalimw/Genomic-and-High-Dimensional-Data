# Genomic-and-High-Dimensional-Data
Visualization and Clustering tools In this analysis we will analyze a single-cell RNA-seq dataset compiled by the Allen Institute. The data set contains cells from a mouse neocortex (region in the brain which governs perception and cognition).  Each row corresponds to a cell. Each column corresponds to the normalized transcript compatibility count (TCC). We might think of entry i, j as the level of expression of gene j in cell i.  The data consists of a counts matrix in file Y and X , along with ground truth labels . The ground truth labels are not necessary for this part, but you may use them to verify that your results are sensible.  Goal: Unveil hierarchical structure of the genes and discover important genes.
